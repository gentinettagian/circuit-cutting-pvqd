# Simulating large quantum systems on small quantum devices using circuit cutting

This repository contains the code and results necessary to reproduce the results in
`G. Gentinetta, F. Metz, G. Carleo. Overhead-constrained circuit knitting for variational quantum dynamics. 2023`

The requirements for the julia environment are given in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files.
